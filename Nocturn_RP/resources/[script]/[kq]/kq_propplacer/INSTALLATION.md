___

### Step 1:
Put the folder into your resources folder

### Step 2:
The script should automatically create a new database table named `kq_propplacer`. But if you want to be 100% safe. Import it manually from
`_installation_extras/kq_propplacer_table.sql`

### Step 3:
Ensure the script in your `server.cfg` file.

```
ensure kq_propplacer
```

### Done
Enjoy the script
